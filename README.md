Inspiration for all things on technical content!

# Sandeep Samuel Medikonda
I'm a technical writer based in Hyderabad, India, mostly authoring content for enterprise software. I work for CA Technologies (now acquired by Broadcom), primarily focusing on content development for the AIOps DX Platform.

## Why did you get into Technical Writing?
At Uni, journalism was what I was aiming to get into. I revamped the student journal, inspired others to pick reporting and was pretty much on the highway to be a journalist. At that time, I also used to read a lot on journalism, media studies, and free society. There was an urge to be an informer - but when I asked myself if I could hold powerful people accountable, or if I could promote honest information in the marketplace - I could not answer a resounding Yes. And hence, I started looking at alternatives where I could still be an informer and I stumbled upon technical writing. I could still write, and the challenge was technology and people - a perfect conundrum. It wasn't planned, but looking back it wasn't accidental either.

2008 - My first organization was a software product company Zeta Interactive which was one of the earliest movers in the email marketing business. I worked briefly with a senior writer and then after couple of months led the entire documentation as a lone writer. The exposure was immense, from authoring user guides, online help, to recommending UX improvements, creating tutorials, and even hosting release demos. It was fast and end-to-end stuff and the learning curve was pretty steep.

## What's your educational background?
I earned my undergraduate degree in English at Madras Christian College in Chennai. MCC shaped my literature but more importantly, shaped my outlook on life.

I also completed my masters in Technical Communication from the University of Portsmouth, UK. I bet you wouldn't meet many technical writers who have an academic degree in the same field, well I'm one of that rare specimen. I should also mention that the subjects included managing documentation projects, technical discourse, electronic publishing, project management, communicating with different audiences, multimedia communication, and human computer interaction design.
